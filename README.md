# Getting Started:
**For Fetching Images:**
Generate URLs like this : </br>
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/animsh/PokemonSprites/main/imagesHQ/10203.png
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/animsh/PokemonSprites/main/imagesHQ/10210.png

Programmatically fetch base forms:
```
int pokemonId = 10203;
String pokemonImageUrl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/animsh/PokemonSprites/main/imagesHQ/' + pokemonId + '.png';

```
#### Note: for now this repo just contains the assests/sprites of pokemons which are missing in Pokeapi. Assests of other pokemons will be added in future (You can use them from pokeapi directly).
